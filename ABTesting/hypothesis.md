## Null Hypothesis
## Binomial Distributed
Binomial distributed with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments which every experiment has two states true, false or success, failure, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success with probability p or failure with probability q = 1 - p.
Binimial distributed is the basis of the popular binomal test of statistical sinificance
